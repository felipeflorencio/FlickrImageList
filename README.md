# FlickrImageList
Made a little Swift project using Flickr API REST request for get image list using specific tag, and show at list, all was made for demonstrate how do with a clean architecture, self made request showing that we don't need for a small things import lib. Showing too how to parse, good practices when need parse, here we used a lot of code, for this we already have good libs, but its was good for showing good crash prevent practice. We use to some kind of "cache" for handle request's that already been done and avoid to much request. So feel free for clone and do any want .
